# Production-Ready Roadmap: ATS Resume Optimizer

## Phase 1: Foundation & MVP

### 1. Project Setup
- Initialize monorepo or separate frontend/backend repos as needed.
- Set up version control (Git) and CI/CD (Vercel integration).
- Configure TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and basic testing tools.

### 2. Core Frontend (Next.js/React)
- Implement minimal, professional UI (desktop & mobile responsive).
- Build upload interface for PDF/DOCX resumes.
- Add Google OAuth login (limit: 3 conversions/day per user).
- Display conversion quota and usage feedback.

### 3. Core Backend/API
- Set up Node.js or serverless functions (API routes in Next.js or Vercel Functions).
- Integrate MongoDB for user and resume metadata storage.
- Implement file parsing (PDF/DOCX to text extraction).
- **Integrate Gemini API as the core backend for AI-powered resume analysis, rephrasing, and keyword enhancement.**
- Enforce strict, clean template for output.
- Implement PDF export of final resume.

### 4. Basic Testing & QA
- Unit tests for parsing, Gemini API integration, and export logic.
- Manual QA for upload, conversion, and export flows.
- Accessibility checks (WCAG basics).

---

## Phase 2: Feature Hardening & Compliance

### 1. Robust Error Handling
- Graceful handling of bad uploads, parsing failures, and Gemini API errors.
- User-friendly error messages and retry options.

### 2. Security & Authentication
- Harden Google OAuth flow (token validation, session management).
- Secure file uploads (virus/malware scanning, file size/type limits).
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention (enforce 3/day quota).

### 3. Production-Ready Infrastructure
- Environment variable management (API keys, DB URIs, Gemini API credentials).
- Logging and monitoring (Vercel/3rd-party tools).
- Automated backups for MongoDB.

### 4. UI/UX Polish
- Loading/progress indicators for uploads and processing (including Gemini API calls).
- Finalize mobile responsiveness and cross-browser support.
- Add onboarding/help modals for new users.

---

## Phase 3: Pre-Launch & Go-Live

### 1. Final QA & Testing
- End-to-end (E2E) tests for all user flows, including Gemini API integration.
- Security audit (OAuth, file handling, data storage, Gemini API usage).
- Performance testing (upload, Gemini API, export speed).

### 2. Documentation
- User-facing: onboarding, FAQ, privacy policy, terms of use.
- Developer-facing: setup, deployment, environment, and contribution guides (including Gemini API integration details).

### 3. Deployment
- Set up production environment on Vercel (custom domain, HTTPS).
- Configure environment variables and secrets (including Gemini API keys).
- Enable analytics/monitoring (Vercel, Sentry, etc.).

### 4. Launch
- Announce beta/launch to target users (colleges, bootcamps, etc.).
- Monitor for issues and collect feedback.

---

## Phase 4: Post-Launch & Iteration

### 1. Support & Maintenance
- Monitor error logs and user feedback (including Gemini API issues).
- Patch bugs and address critical issues quickly.

### 2. Usage Analytics
- Track conversion rates, user retention, quota usage, and Gemini API usage.
- Use insights to inform future features.

### 3. Scalability Planning
- Prepare for increased load (DB scaling, serverless concurrency, Gemini API quota management).
- Plan for future features: multi-template, localization, subscriptions, analytics dashboards.

## Best Practices & Production Readiness Notes
- Prioritize security (OAuth, file handling, data privacy, Gemini API credentials).
- Ensure accessibility and responsive design.
- Maintain clear documentation and onboarding.
- Use CI/CD for all deployments.
- Regularly back up user data and monitor for abuse.
- Monitor Gemini API usage and handle rate limits gracefully.

**This phased plan ensures a structured, iterative path from MVP to a robust, production-ready ATS resume optimization platform, with Gemini API as the core AI backend.**
